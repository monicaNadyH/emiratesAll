He is one of the only crew I have ever flown with who excels in every sense, in everything he does on board, and I believe he is a natural leader, and should be in the position of a purser, because he is more competent than many. With all the changes in the company, I think this would not be impossible for someone like him who has the experience and deserves this as he is a big asset for the company .He is extremely organized, very attentive to all his colleagues, helping in every cabin and teaching the crew something new every time. The way he interacts with people he impose respect, everyone follows him and trusts him. From a service point of view, the way he interacts with the customers I found it so special, passengers during the flight were asking me about him, he is very attentive to details and he is the living version of the OME. He would always be there to help with any problem and I do not see that there would be anything he could not resolve. He is a crew who brings people back, makes customers fly with Emirates because of the experience they have when he is operating, he follows standards in detail, all crew look up to him and follow and respect him, and this is not only my opinion but the entire team feels the same, and I am positive it is the same on every flight he does.",Cabin Crew-Compliments"Dear Amelita, I just flew with one of your shining stars: Christina, 412118.Christina did a great job in building Personal relationships with our F/C customers, anticipating their needs and looking for opportunity to go beyond.She helped Y/C CSV by looking after the flight deck throughout the flight.
