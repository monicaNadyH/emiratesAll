Enthusiastic, professional, empowering, organized and thorough. On the first two legs she empowered her team to deliver a service of highest level. She has her way of keeping the team motivated through encouragement, praise and attention to details. Her leadership of the team set the pace for the remaining legs. No call bells were left unattended, the team was fully customer oriented and organized, due to her guidance. Her teamwork is exceptional, when she finished the JClass full service, she went to take a cart in Economy class to ensure she is a role model and keep her involvement with the team.

"*Linen distribution procedure is found impractical.* -As per new update cabin supervisor and galley operator are distributing linen to all customers one person on each side having linen hanging over the forearm (B777 3class config.) -The points that are found not being practical are following: *While cabin supervisor and galley operator are distributing linens to customers both L2 and R2 crew members are basically waiting for galley operator to come back and start preparing soups. This could be changed in a way where L2 and R2 crew member go and distribute linens to customer and galley operator and cabin supervisor prepare soups and put breads on each tray. *Delivering linen as one person on each side is challenging because it is difficult to assist customers to open their trays as one arm is occupied holding linens. Most of the time cabin crew would need to support themselves by placing one hand on the seat divider in order to assist customers with tray opening, particularly window seats and middle seats where crew have to bend and stretch in order to assist. That in turn puts a lot of pressure on the back. *If customers have their wine and champagne classes placed in the cup holders on seat dividers it becomes easy to flip over those glasses while crew are placing linen on to the table. *Linens are creased. *Cabin crew do not save a lot of time during service by one person linen distribution.",Product Development

Cabin crew often fumbled with the linen in order to arrange it in the correct manner to present, and lay down on the tray table, particularly when they were also required to lean over and assist customers to open their tray tables.

He came on the wheelchair and was listed as WCHC customer however he walked from the aircraft door to his seat with her assistance. Andrada noticed that he seemed to be quite emotional and in a loft of pain. She took time to talk to him, find out what was the problem and looked after him throughout the flight. He was quite upset about the situation he was in and did not like attention or did not want to accept any help. Andrada sat down with him and listened to his story and I believe that that conversation helped him and cheered him up. This gesture was then helpful when the customer fell over whilst walking to the lavatory. Andrada was well informed about his state which helped us to deal with the situation more effectively.",Cabin Crew

The Purser approached Mr. Homa and told him she did not have the authority to upgrade him to First class as part of service recovery, and Mr. Homa initially said he did not believe she did not have the authority to do the free upgrade. Later when I asked Mr. Homa again if he would allow me to place a blanket on his seat, he refused again and said with a raised voice that it was 'Unfucking believable'"" that he was a Platinum member and he could not be upgraded to First class.
