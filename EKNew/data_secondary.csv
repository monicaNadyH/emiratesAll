Due to the need to balance the linen and extract table made for a messy attempt e.g. red wine spilt on aisle customers seat due to precarious position of hanging linen. Full load prevented the linen being placed elsewhere. There was a delay to setting up the social area as I had other duties (videos, PR, Capt, YC). Some customer requests could not be met due to time constraint e.g. several customers seated in row 6 wanted to be served first as they had broken their fast (as most of the cabin was in the situation we could not assist).

It is difficult for crew to lean over and place linen on the A,E,K seats which also looks clumsy and unprofessional, it is impossible to do it as per video on the portal. due to having linens thrown over the arm. Linens stick together and do not open easily as in the video on the portal so sometimes crew have to use 2 hands to separate and open one piece of linen.

"*Linen distribution procedure is found impractical.* -As per new update cabin supervisor and galley operator are distributing linen to all customers one person on each side having linen hanging over the forearm (B777 3class config.) -The points that are found not being practical are following: *While cabin supervisor and galley operator are distributing linens to customers both L2 and R2 crew members are basically waiting for galley operator to come back and start preparing soups. This could be changed in a way where L2 and R2 crew member go and distribute linens to customer and galley operator and cabin supervisor prepare soups and put breads on each tray. *Delivering linen as one person on each side is challenging because it is difficult to assist customers to open their trays as one arm is occupied holding linens. Most of the time cabin crew would need to support themselves by placing one hand on the seat divider in order to assist customers with tray opening, particularly window seats and middle seats where crew have to bend and stretch in order to assist. That in turn puts a lot of pressure on the back. *If customers have their wine and champagne classes placed in the cup holders on seat dividers it becomes easy to flip over those glasses while crew are placing linen on to the table. *Linens are creased. *Cabin crew do not save a lot of time during service by one person linen distribution.",JC Prod / Service

"Feedback As a result of changes to J class service it was observed that cabin crew had some minor difficulties when laying linen in preparation for meal services. Specifically due to the manner in which linen is packed, i.e heavily starched, folded in three ways, and often upside down, crew found it difficult to carry out the process singlehanded. Cabin crew often fumbled with the linen in order to arrange it in the correct manner to present, and lay down on the tray table, particularly when they were also required to lean over and assist customers to open their tray tables. As a result linen often ran down the arm of the crew member, with them fumbling around to ensure that the stack did not fall onto the floor. The process seems to lack any of the finesse or efficiency required in a premium cabin.",JC Prod / Service

None of them were sure of the exact meaning of the words. -We tried fitting the car seat on an empty YC seat, however we did not think it was secured, because the sides were sitting on top of the arm rests on both sides, and there was space between the bottom of the car seat and the passenger seat, I could slip my hand under the car seat. -Due to the above reasons, and after consulting with the OM-E(2.12.1) I did not think the car seat was safe to be used on board.
