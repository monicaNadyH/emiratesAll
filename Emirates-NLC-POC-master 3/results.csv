He went beyond expectation with several elderly and wheelchair customers, on each sector, by constantly checking they were comfortable and ok, assisted them to the lavatory, introducing his team working in that area to them, writing notes for the next crew regarding any special issues that these customers had to deal with, assisting them with arrival procedures into SIN and MEL etc.Rafael was also observed developing his crew during the trip, challenging them to break out of their comfort zone and take on several aspects of service and customer interaction that are normally duties for the CSV on A380. He gave some of them tips on how to initiate customer interaction/PR, to ultimately gain customer feedback on the flight and their experience overall with EK, as they confessed that they don't know how to really do so.
