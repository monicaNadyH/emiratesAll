When Gr2 Reka (s417433) noticed, she tried to help them seat together. She approached few solo customers in the vicinity of the seat, and asked them if they're welling to swap the seats with the family, but all of them declined the offer as they're willing to keep their original seats.  Gr2 Reka went through almost the whole cabin, asking one by one  if they're willing to swap, yet no one agreed.  Although Gr2 Reka eventually couldn't manage to swap them and customers had to keep the original seats, Mr. Persico could see the effort made by Gr2 Reka, and was very appreciating.  Gr2 Reka, looked after the family throughout the flight, and ensured their wellbeing.

***Blankets placed on ALL seats before boarding***  When we boarded the aircraft most of the seats had unused blankets already placed on them.

"*Crew rest reduced by half an hour* All crew were given 1 hour and 30 minutes of rest instead of the 2 hours, as per the Crew Rest Strategy The reason being that we were short of 1 FG1, so that we had to upgrade 1 GR1 to First Class, and 1 GR2 to Business Class With a full cabin in all classes, this meant that there was not a full crew complement properly trained in First Class and Business Class services respectively, and Economy Class was 1 crew short The crew did their very best so that the shortage would not impact negatively on the customer experience Moreover, due to turbulence, the crew had to sit down for about 15 minutes on the Captain's advice Therefore, the rest had to be reduced"

"*** LANDING PERMIT & BAGGAGE DECLARATION FORMS FOR INDIA ***  I have written about this in the past, and I have recently seen the changes to the layout of the S.I.M. and thought I would write again.  There is no information in either the SIM or Flight Instructions on how to exactly handle the paperwork for select destinations to India.  On today's flight to HYD, we have flight deck crew laying over and the cabin crew returning to Dubai.  The Purser folder contained two sets of forms, the Crew Baggage Declaration and the Crew Landing Permit.  Not until a regular flyer to India, pointed out that the Landing Permit form is only for layover flight. SO I had already had the crew start writing on the forms. And I found out about this information only after completing the forms with everyone's name on it."

During the time I waited for Brittany, not knowing where she was, my Cabin supervisors and myself finished to do the following:*Documents checks*Safe Talk*Flight instructions (as per my request)When all of the above had been done, Brittany had still not yet arrived, thus rather than conveying my goal and expectations (main briefing before Team Talk in groups), without Brittany been present, I went to the Briefing Desk to see if she was around and noticed three people in the Grooming Office. I met with the Grooming Officer and asked if Brittany was present which she answered that she was as she had been selected to have a Grooming check. The Grooming Officer stated that Brittany was wearing nail polish which was too clear and as a result she requested Brittany to paint her nails over with red colour, as a result this took some time thus it was the reason Brittany was not at the Briefing room yet."
