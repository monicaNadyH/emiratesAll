 Suggestion of adding a small percentage of vegetarian meals in western flights  In every single flight I do  I always have requests for spare vegetarian meals. I would recommend to add a small percentage of vegetarian meals as we have a lot of vegetarian customers and not only AVML but also a lot of western customers are nowadays vegetarians. In many flights is not possible to make possible everyone's request as we do not have anything vegetarian to offer. It would be great to have a small percentage of vegetarian meals in order to enhance the customers experience.,YC Prod / Service
