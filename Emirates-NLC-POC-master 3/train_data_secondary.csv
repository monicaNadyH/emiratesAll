"   Feedback   MURCURE HOTEL on Stevens, Singapore    The hotel for all crew in Singapore changed to MURCURE ON STEVENS, since end of December 2017. The rooms allocated for all crew, except CAPT and First officer, was found to be extremely small and compact. There was no table available to keep your belongings, to have a meal or to work on. There wasn't any designated space or stand/stool for suitcase, thus it had to be left on the floor, which took away the little space available to walk around the bed. The bathrooms were very small and compact. It was quite difficult to find a space to keep your toiletries as there was no counter top in the bathrooms. At least 6 crew, including my self, did not have hot water in the shower or wash basin taps. Internet services, thus not considered essential, but helps to complete any left over reports and VRs from flight, was very poor and kept disconnecting on and off.",Hotel Feedback
