Her excellent skills and attentive care was mentioned by Mr. Mullany and Mr. Cook, both traveling in seats 01E/01F, traveling from AKL to DXB. According to them, this was their best flight ever with Emirates, mostly due to the care displayed by the entire team, specially Vanessa. On the return sector, myself, J/C team and F/C team were challenged by a difficult situation involving a family of eight members who had their travel plans disrupted by flight cancellations and eventual downgrade to a lower cabin of travel. Vanessa and her team put the best effort in order to turn a very frustrating experience into a positive one.

STD was 10:05 and we remained on the aircraft till 12:45, until the decision was reached that we needed an aircraft change. Being the longest ULR in our network, and then having a 4 hours delay on top of that, we were very close to running out of hours. During this time the communication to the flight deck was that we would be short of crew to have a whole replacement to take over from us. By the time we changed aircraft, the cleaning and catering were still underway, so the crews' prioritisation and proactivity was a must, in order for us to be legal for the flight.

She informed me where everything was so I didn't have to look for anything. After the first sector she cleared the ovens and put all the remaining meals in one place, she loaded the meals for the next sector and replenished bars.  When I cut my finger she quickly helped me with a band aid and tissues.  She was promptly attending call bells and delivering customers requests. She never complained about how many carts she had to take, or that she had to do tea and coffee on one side, always one step forward. Responsive, helpful, kind and friendly, a real team player.

She was at all time communicating with me and her colleagues about the next step of the service. Right after the service she went to assist her colleagues in  J class without being prompt to do so.  Juxhina  never really had to do an actual we care schedule as she was constantly in the cabin assisting our customers  and making sure they are happy and comfortable.
